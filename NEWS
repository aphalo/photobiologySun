photobiologySun 0.1.3
=====================

Edited the script to use .spct as name tag for spectra instead of .dt.
Rebuilt with current versions of photobiology and MayaCalc packages.
Edited the vignette to make use of the new function plot.source.spct() specializing the plot() generic.

photobiologySun 0.1.2
=====================

Now spectra are in data.frame and data.table compatible "source.spct" objects.

photobiologySun 0.1.1
=====================

Added several standard spectra for extraterrestrial and terrestrial solar spectrum from WMO and ASTM. All dataframes now include both spectral photon irradiance and spectral energy irradiance values.

photobiologySun 0.1.0
=====================

Just one example spectrum.
